# CIS94-tasklist-1

For this project, add a function called *display_tasks* that will take an array
of tasks as a parameter and will display them when the page **index.php** is accessed by the web browser.  
Call the function from within the file **index.php** in this project repository, it is already provided.  
When this repository is first cloned and accessed from xampp, it will have an error at the bottom of the
page,this is because display_tasks does no exist in the task_functions.php file yet, 
you will need to create it.

Hint, look at the function **display_csv_file** in the file
called **task_functions.php**, the function that you will write will be called *display_tasks*.  It is very 
similar to the display_csv_file function except that the $tasks array is provided as a parameter to the function.
